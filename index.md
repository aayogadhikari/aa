# All About Aayog Adhikari

  Hello! My name is Aayog Adhikari, and today, I am going to tell you guys all about me.

## Where and when I Was Born

  I was born in Columbia, Missouri, at around 4:00 AM in the morning. At that time, my grandma had come to the US to see me for the first time. She was very excited to meet me. Also, my mom was 25 years old, my dad was 31, and my grandma was 45 years old. I was also born at Mercy Hospital.

## When I Was 1 Year Old  
  
  At this time, it was May 9, 2017 to May 9, 2018. At the beginning of 2018, I had started eating chocolate. And in late 2017, I went to a Nepali festival where I was given a necklace made of flowers and a long piece of thread on the inside. My mom took many photos of us and one of them showed me on a concrete road. Here's what it looks like:
